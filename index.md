# Parkinson's Disease Classification using two datasets of preprocessed speech signals

In this project, we have used two datasets to work on a classification problem of Parkinson's Disease. 

For a summary of the project, please see our [presentation](https://github.com/nadje/Parkinsons-Disease-Classification/blob/main/Presentaci%C3%B3n_Parkinson.pptx.pdf).

# Datasets 

### Dataset 1

The dataset was created by Max Little of the University of Oxford, in collaboration with the National Centre for Voice and Speech, Denver, Colorado, who recorded the speech signals. The original study published the feature extraction methods for general voice disorders.

This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in the table is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds one of 195 voice recording from these individuals ("name" column). The "status" column is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD.

### Dataset 2 

This dataset is collected from UCI Machine Learning Repository through the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinson%27s+Disease+Classification#

The data used in this study were gathered from 188 patients with PD (107 men and 81 women) with ages ranging from 33 to 87 (65.1 ± 10.9) at the Department of Neurology in  Cerrahpaşa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University. The control group consists of 64 healthy individuals (23 men and 41 women) with ages varying between 41 and 82 (61.1 ± 8.9). During the data collection process, the microphone is set to 44.1 KHz and following the physician's examination, the sustained phonation of the vowel /a/ was collected from each subject with three repetitions.

Various speech signal processing algorithms including Time Frequency Features, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Wavelet Transform based Features, Vocal Fold Features and TWQT features have been applied to the speech recordings of Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients to extract clinically useful information for PD assessment.

Two analyses were conducted for this dataset:
